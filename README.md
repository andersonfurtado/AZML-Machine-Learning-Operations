## Overview

In this project, we use Microsoft Azure to demonstrate machine learning operations. This project used the Bank Marketing data set. This dataset was used to create a classification model to predict whether the customer will sign a term deposit or not using the AutoML feature in Azure ML Studio. We used Azure to set up a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it and consume it. We also create, publish and consume a pipeline.

In this project, we follow the steps below:
- Authentication
- Automated ML Experiment
- Deploy the best model
- Enable logging
- Swagger Documentation
- Consume model endpoints
- Create and publish a pipeline

## Project Steps (Screenshots with short description)
We following the below steps:

### Step 1: Authentication
